Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",,SRP059841,"{""Watershed Discovery Project Homepage"": ""http://www.watersheddiscovery.ca/""}",watershed biome Raw sequence reads,Metagenomics,,SRA274315,,,,,freshwater metagenome,,502732920,/dataset/647855

A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence.

Previous studies found that eddies can affect phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community structure, primary productivity and nitrogen fixation. A considerable fraction of the marine bacterioplankton consists of photoheterhophs. These bacteria can use light to generate biochemical energy for transport and metabolic needs. Unlike photoautotrophs they depend on organic carbon for growth and biomass production. Photoheterotrophy can potentially enhance bacterial growth and/or survival in oligotrophic oceanic conditions. A common group of photoheterotrophs consists of proteorhodopsin (pr) – bearing bacteria. The pr gene occurs in diverse microbial taxa including SAR11, a dominant Alphaproteobacteria clade. We hypothesize that anticyclonic eddies, which facilitate nutrient poor conditions by downwelling surface water, favor photoheterhophy. In November 2013 we conducted an oceanographic survey aboard R/V Mediterranean Explorer with the goal to assess the abundance, diversity and expression of photoheterophic genes in an anticyclonic eddy in the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The results of this study will shed light on the potential role of physical and chemical gradients created by mesoscale eddies on changes in photoheterotrophic communities, which can have global effects on ocean biogeochemistry and energy flow.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2016-12-16"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2014-06-18""}",ERP006107,,PHOTOHETEROPHY IN A MESOSCALE ANTICYCLONIC EDDY IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA,Metagenomics,,ERA319457,,,,,metagenome,,6365617913,/dataset/2643333

A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence. Our data also suggest larvae as a dispersal mode for Lessepsian migration of Indo-Pacific species into the Mediterranean. Our method, which facilitates quantitative ecological inferences at high taxonomic resolution, is applicable to any larval community and could assist in coral-reef conservation as well as fishery management efforts","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-10-10"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-05-01""}",ERP022794,,"We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples in the Gulf of Aqaba collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons and analyzed their metagenome using NGS technology.",Other,,ERA928658,,,,,metagenome,,471542942,/dataset/3034144

In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeographic patters of Arctic microbiome diversity and distribution along two oceanographic transects in the Marginal Ice Zone around Svalbard, within strong environmental gradients (Ripfjorden, Kongsfjorden). A total of 11 stations were sample at three depths (surface, chlorophyll maximum and bottom) during the Norwegian Polar Institute MOSJ-ICE 2016 plankton-monitoring program. Samples were concentrated on board through Sterivex 0.2 mm filtration and preserved at -80ºC for later DNA extraction. Amplification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were performed and sequenced in Illumina MiSeq with a sequence depth of about 100 thousand readpairs. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic MOSJ-ICE16 data sets collection comprises highly complex and diverse microbial communities with a marked biogeographic pattern of distribution. Strong links were identified between bacterioplanckton and phytoplankton/picophytoplankton distribution driven by environmental and biogeochemical forces, most relevant to unravel the role of microbial pathways in supporting Arctic Ocean Primary productivity and system integrity.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-06-21"", ""Study keyword"": ""UniEuk_EukBank"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-01-29""}",ERP106348,,Arctic microbiome along Svalbard Cross Shelf transects,Other,,ERA1729984,,,,,metagenome,,3688413029,/dataset/6428539

A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence.

Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",,SRP059841,"{""Watershed Discovery Project Homepage"": ""http://www.watersheddiscovery.ca/""}",watershed biome Raw sequence reads,Metagenomics,,SRA274315,,,,,freshwater metagenome,,536320736,/dataset/1461129

As fresh and marine waters mix in estuaries and river plumes, the salinity, temperature, and nutrient gradients that are generated strongly influence bacterioplankton community structure, yet, a parallel shift in functional diversity has not been described. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were conducted on five water samples spanning the salinity gradient of the Columbia River coastal margin, including river, estuary, plume, and ocean, in August 2010. Samples were pre-filtered through 3 µm filters and collected on 0.2 µm filters, thus results were focused on changes among free-living microbial communities. Results from metagenomic 16S rRNA sequences showed taxonomically distinct bacterial communities in river, estuary, and coastal ocean. Despite the strong salinity gradient observed over sampling locations (0 to 33), the functional gene profiles in the metagenomes were very similar from river to ocean with an average similarity of 82%. The metatranscriptomes, however, were an average of only 31% similar. We observed shifts from river to ocean in the abundance of genes encoding specific functions, such as catabolic pathways, osmoregulators, and metal transporters. Additionally, genes specifying both bacterial oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis were highly abundant and expressed in the estuary and plume. Denitrification genes were found throughout the Columbia River coastal margin, and most highly expressed in the estuary.

This initial metagenomic analysis explores nutrient pathways, antibiotic production, quorum sensing, motility, and other genes that may be essential to the diatom-bacterial symbiotic interaction.

Human activities, which influence microbial communities and environmental resistomes, can inadvertently generate additional risks. In this work, we analyzed microbial communities and the resistome in samples collected at three city hospitals and three sites along the Bogotá River, a vital freshwater supply for the extended metropolitan area of Bogotá. Water parameters indicated an increase in contamination and the presence of antibiotics and other commonly used drugs as the river passed through the city. Community profiles done by 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole metagenome sequencing revealed diverse microbial communities that varied among sites and years sampled, but tended to separate river samples upstream of the city from more contaminated hospital and downstream river samples. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), identified in the metagenomes, were more abundant in the more contaminated water samples from hospitals and the sites downstream of the city. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistant pathogens were also recovered from these sites. We found evidence of mobile genetic elements localized next to ARGs in assembled metagenomic contigs, suggesting the possibility of mobilizing resistance markers in these aquatic microbial populations. This study shows that anthropic activities alter microbial communities and bring together microorganisms of varied origins where interactions can affect both abundance and the possible spread of ARGs in water ecosystems that are fundamental to human welfare.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-09-16"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-10-12""}",ERP104635,,Anthropic Effects on Aquatic Microbial Communities and their Resistomes,Other,,ERA1123510,,,,,metagenomes,,1630684200,/dataset/3631106

This paradigm is restrictive because it relies on century-old technologies and does not consider the broader impact of microbial pollution on the larger ecosystem. Furthermore, this approach enables only reactive responses focused on human health rather than proactive measures that protect water at its source: the watershed.Our goal is to change the way we monitor water quality in our watersheds. Advances in genomic technology have enabled us to broadly study the microbial community composition of watersheds and to understand how this community changes in response to environmental perturbations. By broadly surveying the microbial community in our watersheds we intend to discover novel microbial indicators associated with polluted versus healthy watersheds. Our study has three principal goals:1) To use metagenomics to measure the impact of pollution on the bacterial communities in different watersheds.2) To use amplicon sequencing of various microbial genes including the 16S and 18S rRNA and gp23 genes to quantify the microbiome, which consist of viruses, bacteria, and small eukaryotes (which include protists and fungi), of different watersheds.3) To create novel tests that monitor these microbial community changes in order to detect pollution and pinpoint the specific source of the pollution.By creating new tests that focus on overall watershed health, as opposed to just human health, we will provide the advanced tools needed to protect our watersheds.",,SRP059841,"{""Watershed Discovery Project Homepage"": ""http://www.watersheddiscovery.ca/""}",watershed biome Raw sequence reads,Metagenomics,,SRA274315,,,,,freshwater metagenome,,2078364800,/dataset/457027

A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence. Our data also suggest larvae as a dispersal mode for Lessepsian migration of Indo-Pacific species into the Mediterranean. Our method, which facilitates quantitative ecological inferences at high taxonomic resolution, is applicable to any larval community and could assist in coral-reef conservation as well as fishery management efforts","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-10-10"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-05-01""}",ERP022794,,"We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples in the Gulf of Aqaba collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons and analyzed their metagenome using NGS technology.",Other,,ERA928659,,,,,metagenome,,808000000,/dataset/3154213

Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.

The acquisition of comprehensive gene catalogues of the human gut metagenome using “next generation sequencing” has immensely advanced our insight into the complex metagenome-host genome interaction and the connection between common human diseases and the gut microbiota. Causal links are difficult to establish in humans, and therefore, mice still serve as important models for functional studies. We used HiSeq2000-based whole metagenome sequencing to establish a catalogue of 2.6 million non-redundant microbial genes from faecal samples of 184 mice representing different strains, fed different diets, obtained from different providers, and kept in different housing laboratories to secure high diversity and representation. Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.   As we have accounted for these factors in creating the catalogue, it provides a useful reference for future studies, including studies using short reads for comprehensive analyses of the mouse gut microbiome.",,ERP008710,,A Catalogue of the Mouse Gut Metagenome,Other,,ERA384344,,,,,mouse gut metagenome,,6584067611,/dataset/2328117

The isolation of DNA from microbiome specimens is a key prerequisite for such examinations, but challenges remain in obtaining sufficient DNA quantities required for certain sequencing approaches, achieving accurate genomic inference of microbiome composition, and facilitating comparability of findings across specimen types and sequencing projects. These aspects are particularly relevant for the genomics-based global surveillance of infectious agents and antimicrobial resistance from different reservoirs. Here, we compare a total of eight DNA extraction procedures for three specimen types (human feces, pig feces, hospital sewage), assess DNA extraction using spike-in controls and different types of beads for bead-beating facilitating cell lysis. We evaluate DNA concentration, purity, and stability, and microbial community composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and for selected samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Our results suggest that inferred community composition was dependent on inherent specimen properties as well as DNA extraction method. We further show that bead-beating or enzymatic treatment can increase the extraction of DNA from Gram-positive bacteria. Final DNA quantities could be increased by isolating DNA from a larger volume of cell lysate compared to standard protocols. Based on this insight, we have designed an improved DNA isolation procedure that can be used for the three examined specimen types and potentially also for other biological specimens.",,ERP016486,,Impact of the Sample Type and DNA Isolation Procedure on Genomic Inference of Microbiome Composition,Other,,ERA676188,,,,,metagenome,,1149260640,/dataset/594225

While the microbiome has been linked to social interaction in animals, gut-brain connections that regulate this complex behavior remain entirely undescribed. Herein, we demonstrate that depletion of microbiota in mice not only impairs social behavior, but also activates specific brain regions related to canonical stress responses. Social deviation in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice is associated with elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, which is primarily produced via activation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Accordingly, removal of the adrenal gland, antagonism of the glucocorticoid receptor, and pharmacological inhibition of corticosterone synthesis effectively correct social deficits. Genetic ablation of the glucocorticoid receptor in specific brain regions and chemogenetic inactivation of hypothalamic neurons dramatically increase social behavior. Further, we identify specific bacterial metabolites that suppress activation of the HPA axis and improve social impairment. These findings reveal that the gut microbiome regulates social behavior by co-opting neuronal circuits that control stress responses in mice.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-03-27"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-03-27""}",ERP113632,,Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice,Other,,ERA1735279,,,,,mouse gut metagenome,UBERON:feces,2739846982,/dataset/3888103

The acquisition of comprehensive gene catalogues of the human gut metagenome using “next generation sequencing” has immensely advanced our insight into the complex metagenome-host genome interaction and the connection between common human diseases and the gut microbiota. Causal links are difficult to establish in humans, and therefore, mice still serve as important models for functional studies. We used HiSeq2000-based whole metagenome sequencing to establish a catalogue of 2.6 million non-redundant microbial genes from faecal samples of 184 mice representing different strains, fed different diets, obtained from different providers, and kept in different housing laboratories to secure high diversity and representation. Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.

We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",,SRP078001,,Maturation of the Infant Microbiome Community Structure and Function Across Multiple Body Sites,Other,,SRA452779,,,,,human metagenome,,525809265,/dataset/1351381

The acquisition of comprehensive gene catalogues of the human gut metagenome using “next generation sequencing” has immensely advanced our insight into the complex metagenome-host genome interaction and the connection between common human diseases and the gut microbiota. Causal links are difficult to establish in humans, and therefore, mice still serve as important models for functional studies. We used HiSeq2000-based whole metagenome sequencing to establish a catalogue of 2.6 million non-redundant microbial genes from faecal samples of 184 mice representing different strains, fed different diets, obtained from different providers, and kept in different housing laboratories to secure high diversity and representation. Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.

This is because they have characteristics similar to these products. However, there are few data in the literature regarding the actions of OEs in axenic cultures of anaerobic ruminal microorganisms. Thus, a project is proposed to: evaluate the efficacy of essential oils from the sequencing of rumen microorganisms of finished cattle in confinement; determine the genes expressed by the ruminal microbiota; identify pure cultures affected by the presence of OEs; to observe the effect of OEs on ruminal bacteria by electron microscopy; to evaluate the microbial resistance of OEs in ruminal bacteria; and evaluate the metatranscriptome of axenic culture of ruminal bacteria cultured with OEs. It is expected to identify species strongly affected by OEs and metabolic routes and mechanisms used by ruminal microorganisms to deal with the presence of OEs and their active compounds.

However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",,SRP078001,,Maturation of the Infant Microbiome Community Structure and Function Across Multiple Body Sites,Other,,SRA452779,,,,,human metagenome,,1936925952,/dataset/1913850

DNA was shotgun sequenced on the Illumina platform and sequence reads were annotated for taxonomy and function by comparison to a database of protein coding genes. In a statistical analysis of diversity, taxonomy and functional potential of the microbiomes, age was revealed as the only factor with significant effects on the variation observed. No significant effects were detected for gender, neutering, or age when neutered (19 or 31 weeks). At 18 weeks of age the microbiome was dominated by the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (35% and 20% average abundance). Structural and functional diversity was significantly increased by week 30 but there was no further significant increase. At 42 weeks of age the most abundant genera were Bacteroides (16%), Prevotella (14%) and Megasphaera (8%). Significant differences in functional potential included an enrichment for genes in energy metabolism (carbon metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation) and depletion in cell motility (flagella and chemotaxis).

The acquisition of comprehensive gene catalogues of the human gut metagenome using “next generation sequencing” has immensely advanced our insight into the complex metagenome-host genome interaction and the connection between common human diseases and the gut microbiota. Causal links are difficult to establish in humans, and therefore, mice still serve as important models for functional studies. We used HiSeq2000-based whole metagenome sequencing to establish a catalogue of 2.6 million non-redundant microbial genes from faecal samples of 184 mice representing different strains, fed different diets, obtained from different providers, and kept in different housing laboratories to secure high diversity and representation. Similar to the human gut microbiome, more than 99% of the genes in the catalogue were bacterial, suggesting that the mouse microbiota overall comprises between 800 and 900 bacterial species. A core mouse gut microbiome was defined at the genus level comprising 60 genera, 25 of which were shared with the core genera in the human gut microbiome. Although the mouse gut microbiome was functionally similar to its human counterpart, sharing 79.9% of its KEGG orthologous groups, only 4.0% of the mouse gut microbial genes were shared with those identified in human gut microbiome, emphasising the need for a specific mouse catalogue. We observed marked differences regarding provider, housing laboratory, strains, gender and feed, emphasizing the need for carefully controlled experimental conditions and caution comparing data from different laboratories.

However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007).

However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",,SRP078001,,Maturation of the Infant Microbiome Community Structure and Function Across Multiple Body Sites,Other,,SRA452779,,,,,human metagenome,,2168214180,/dataset/279288

However, it is not yet known when in early development our microbiota community structure and function is initially established and diversifies. We thus sought to assess the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota, and assess the impact of mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women (n=81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks post-delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n=81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at delivery. Samples were collected for each maternal-infant dyad across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogenous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks, the infant microbiota structure and function had significantly expanded and diversified, with body site serving as the primary determinant of the bacterial community composition and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with Cesarean delivery in some body sites (oral, nares, and skin; p<0.001, R2 = 0.038), this was not true in neonatal stool (meconium) and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. By 6 weeks of age, the infant microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (p<0.001, R2 = 0.189), and no discernable differences in neither community structure nor function by Cesarean delivery were identifiable (p=0.057, R2 = 0.007). We conclude that within the first 6 weeks of life, the infant microbiota undergoes significant reorganization that is primarily driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.",,SRP078001,,Maturation of the Infant Microbiome Community Structure and Function Across Multiple Body Sites,Other,,SRA452779,,,,,human metagenome,,2968079669,/dataset/123716

Microbiome analysis revealed four potential T1D-protective taxa and four T1D-accelerating taxa, and a network linking specific microbial taxa to differences in ileal gene expression was identified. This simplified animal model has improved understanding of the mechanisms by which early-life gut microbiome perturbations alter host intestinal responses, contributing to T1D.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-08-03"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-05-03""}",ERP108585,,Antibiotic-induced acceleration of Type 1 diabetes alters intestinal innate pathway maturation,Other,,ERA1421282,,,,,mouse gut metagenome,,2165076958,/dataset/4827590

While the microbiome has been linked to social interaction in animals, gut-brain connections that regulate this complex behavior remain entirely undescribed. Herein, we demonstrate that depletion of microbiota in mice not only impairs social behavior, but also activates specific brain regions related to canonical stress responses. Social deviation in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice is associated with elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, which is primarily produced via activation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Accordingly, removal of the adrenal gland, antagonism of the glucocorticoid receptor, and pharmacological inhibition of corticosterone synthesis effectively correct social deficits. Genetic ablation of the glucocorticoid receptor in specific brain regions and chemogenetic inactivation of hypothalamic neurons dramatically increase social behavior. Further, we identify specific bacterial metabolites that suppress activation of the HPA axis and improve social impairment. These findings reveal that the gut microbiome regulates social behavior by co-opting neuronal circuits that control stress responses in mice.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-03-27"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-03-27""}",ERP113632,,Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice,Other,,ERA1735279,,,,,mouse gut metagenome,UBERON:feces,3045231798,/dataset/5632433

This information was paired with 16S amplicon sequencing, environmental measurements, and denitrification end product measurements in order to elucidate the complex relationships mentioned above. Distinct patterns of denitrification gene abundance were observed at the landscape scale. One subset of denitrification genes, nirS, nosZ, and cNor, were found to co-occur at sites with environmental conditions most favorable for denitrification, indicating that specialized denitrifying communities exist at these sites. Moreover, the genes nirK and qNor were found to show a negative correlation with the previously mentioned gene subset.

Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhousegases (GHG—CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbialcommunity members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimatelyreduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-01-09"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-01-08""}",ERP113113,"{""PUBMED"": ""24722629""}",Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities in an upland Alaskan boreal forest,Other,,ERA1714073,,,,,soil metagenome,,7049037955,/dataset/5268708

This information was paired with 16S amplicon sequencing, environmental measurements, and denitrification end product measurements in order to elucidate the complex relationships mentioned above. Distinct patterns of denitrification gene abundance were observed at the landscape scale. One subset of denitrification genes, nirS, nosZ, and cNor, were found to co-occur at sites with environmental conditions most favorable for denitrification, indicating that specialized denitrifying communities exist at these sites. Moreover, the genes nirK and qNor were found to show a negative correlation with the previously mentioned gene subset. Soils with higher levels of nirS, nosZ, and cNor were observed to have higher denitrification process rates.

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,540311134,/dataset/4844867

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,544412976,/dataset/4619938

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,548519336,/dataset/5146662

Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively.

Using metagenomic analysis, this study provides an unbiased estimate of the relative abundance for all denitrification genes in a small headwater catchment with predominantly agricultural or forest land cover. This information was paired with 16S amplicon sequencing, environmental measurements, and denitrification end product measurements in order to elucidate the complex relationships mentioned above. Distinct patterns of denitrification gene abundance were observed at the landscape scale. One subset of denitrification genes, nirS, nosZ, and cNor, were found to co-occur at sites with environmental conditions most favorable for denitrification, indicating that specialized denitrifying communities exist at these sites. Moreover, the genes nirK and qNor were found to show a negative correlation with the previously mentioned gene subset. Soils with higher levels of nirS, nosZ, and cNor were observed to have higher denitrification process rates.

Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly impacted by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration.

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,741660824,/dataset/5637088

A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly impacted by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested forests.",,ERP009498,,Forest harvesting reduces the soil metagenomic potential for biomass decomposition,Other,,ERA739734,,,,,soil metagenome,,19147419300,/dataset/1329328

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,2008000000,/dataset/5845215

Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly impacted by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested forests.",,ERP009498,,Forest harvesting reduces the soil metagenomic potential for biomass decomposition,Other,,ERA739734,,,,,soil metagenome,,54045320100,/dataset/880483

However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses.

Here we present a metagenomic analysis of tiny wind-blown supraglacial sediment (cryoconite) from Baltoro (Pakistani Karakoram) and Forni (Italian Alps) glaciers providing evidence for the occurrence in these environments of different and previously neglected metabolic pathways. Indeed, we observed high abundance of heterotrophic anoxygenic phototrophs, suggesting that light might directly supplement the energy demand of some bacterial strains allowing them to use as carbon source organic molecules which otherwise would be respired.

The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the world’s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients. Ongoing shotgun sequencing will provide more detailed information on the functional traits present in lake sediments. This study highlights the role of microbial communities in the transfer of resources from terrestrial ecosystems, and improves our understanding of how catchment disturbances affect boreal aquatic ecosystems.",,ERP016063,,Daisy Lake Shotgun Test,Other,,ERA763476,,,,,freshwater sediment metagenome,,1429425303,/dataset/2867822

Reads were corrected and assembled with SPAdes and then binned. One bin was selected for further analysis, since it was determined that contigs in that bin belonged to several, very similar (strain or species level) organisms. Contigs in this bin were filtered by coverage, to try to get as close to a single organism. Reads from Loki, corrected by SPAdes, were mapped to the whole Loki metagenome and reads mapping the selected contigs were extracted and reassembled.

Comparable or even higher numbers of complete CAZyme genes were annotated in our datasets compared with the datasets of cattle rumen and termite intestines, which are two proven outstanding repertories for CAZyme genes. Our work emphasized the agarlytic genes and genomes because of the great potential of agar in the bio-energy field. The agarose-degrading activities of 30 agarases derived from MGSs were determined by heterologous expression based on the numerous complete open-reading frames rarely obtained in most metagenomic sequencing studies. Accordingly, 4 agarases with potential for practical production were found. Analysis of signal peptides showed a probable economical and collaborative process in agarose utilization among the MGSs. Six draft genomes were recovered, and the metabolic pathway of agarose was speculated through the first attempt in investigating the metagenomics of MGSs. Our results showed the great value of MGSs in mining CAZyme genes.

The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the world’s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients. Ongoing shotgun sequencing will provide more detailed information on the functional traits present in lake sediments. This study highlights the role of microbial communities in the transfer of resources from terrestrial ecosystems, and improves our understanding of how catchment disturbances affect boreal aquatic ecosystems.",,ERP016063,,Daisy Lake Shotgun Test,Other,,ERA652523,,,,,freshwater sediment metagenome,,409528920,/dataset/1195493

The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the world’s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients. Ongoing shotgun sequencing will provide more detailed information on the functional traits present in lake sediments. This study highlights the role of microbial communities in the transfer of resources from terrestrial ecosystems, and improves our understanding of how catchment disturbances affect boreal aquatic ecosystems.",,ERP016063,,Daisy Lake Shotgun Test,Other,,ERA763595,,,,,freshwater sediment metagenome,,1883203035,/dataset/428518

The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the world’s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients.

The boreal ecozone holds an estimated 60% of the world’s fresh water, but lakes in this region tend to be nutrient-poor and less productive, making them especially reliant on carbon subsidies from riparian litterfall. The availability of these carbon subsidies for aquatic food webs depends on microbial communities, but little is known about how the taxonomic and functional diversity of heterotrophic bacteria might influence the rate at which this OM is decomposed in natural systems. Drawing upon biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory, we predicted that decomposition rates, indicative of both food web production and whole-lake carbon cycling, increase with the taxonomic and functional diversity of bacterial communities. We characterized both bacterial community composition and microbial functional traits in nearshore sediments from 8 catchments along a gradient of terrestrial OM inputs using next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics). We found that both species richness and composition explained variation in rates of OM decomposition among sites. Differences in species composition were largely driven by 17 bacterial families, with abundances of Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria changing along OM gradients. Ongoing shotgun sequencing will provide more detailed information on the functional traits present in lake sediments.

However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses. Analyses of these bins revealed that Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-10-01"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-12-05""}",ERP105559,,Metagenome data from DNA stable isotope probing of Stiffkey saltmarsh sediment microcosms to investigate methanogenesis from choline,Other,,ERA1153289,,,,,sediment metagenome,,4414715597,/dataset/5068173

We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by ~12.6 cal. kyr BP, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at ~11.5 cal. kyr BP, and boreal forest ~10 cal. kyr BP. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6 cal. kyr BP, are unlikely to have travelled this route into the Americas. However, later groups may have used this north-south passageway.",,ERP016137,,Postglacial viability and colonization in North America's ice-free corridor,Other,,ERA686396,,,,,sediment metagenome,,858864897,/dataset/133385

However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses.

Current knowledge of this functional guild is mainly based on isolated or enriched syntrophs due to past methodological limitations. However, it is unclear whether these reference organisms reflect the true ecological properties and in situ activities of the syntrophs that predominate in full-scale systems. Here we describe novel, metabolically versatile bacterial species playing key roles in SCFA oxidation which were ubiquitous in full-scale anaerobic sludge digesters. A genome-guided metatranscriptomic approach was employed, with 198 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) generated from the microbiome of two digesters. The transcriptomic response of individual MAG was studied after stimulation with low concentration of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, to identify the positively responsive members. Such responding MAGs included one bacterium of the family Pelotomaculaceae, and two bacteria of the class Desulfomonilia, which encoded complete propionate or butyrate beta-oxidation pathways that were significantly upregulated under propionate or butyrate stimulation, respectively. These three SCFA oxidizers were detected in most of the 38 investigated digesters, and encoded unique genomic features compared with the well-characterized populations, including the metabolic pathways for phosphite oxidation, nitrite, or sulfate reduction.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-03-31"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-02-18""}",ERP113854,,Investigating the response of digester metagenomes to various short-chain fatty acids using genome-centric metatranscriptomics,Other,,ERA1745989,,,,,anaerobic digester metagenome,,9867431476,/dataset/5260661

Second, I want to determine whether antibiotic resistance genes are under active selection within WWTPs. To accomplish this second goal, I will evaluate whether antibiotic resistance genes are actively transcribed, which would suggest potential direct selection. I will also test whether antibiotic resistance genes correlate with biodiversity, where I expect that a negative relationship between biodiversity and antibiotic resistance genes is indicative of active selection.

To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 oC for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 ± 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial activity (from 874 and 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 and 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, a COD removal between 68.9 % and 83.2 % was achieved at an organic loading rate ranging from 3.3 to 5.9 kg m-3 d-1. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tet genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron) in anaerobic sludge on Day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those inoculated on Day 0 (P< 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3,720 ± 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 ± 4 % at an OLR 1.2 ± 0.2 kg m-3 d-1, and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P< 0.01). The above result demonstrated that enhanced hydrolysis as a pretreatment method could enable efficient anaerobic treatment of oxytetracycline production wastewater containing high concentrations of oxytetracycline with significantly lower generation of ARGs.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-12-03"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-12-04""}",ERP020400,,Anaerobic Treatment of Antibiotic Production Wastewater Pretreated with Enhanced Hydrolysis: Simultaneous Reduction of COD and ARGs,Other,,ERA771265,,,,,metagenome,,6003907200,/dataset/5121529

Second, I want to determine whether antibiotic resistance genes are under active selection within WWTPs. To accomplish this second goal, I will evaluate whether antibiotic resistance genes are actively transcribed, which would suggest potential direct selection. I will also test whether antibiotic resistance genes correlate with biodiversity, where I expect that a negative relationship between biodiversity and antibiotic resistance genes is indicative of active selection. I will use a metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach to test for the presence and expression of target genes.

Furthermore, contaminated wastewater stored in tailings dams may pose an environmental threat through the potential for leakage into local groundwater. Microbial communities are often used for biodegradation and environmental remediation, however, little is known about the membership and metabolic potential of SCN-degrading consortia. Application and improvement of the remediation strategy will benefit from an understanding of organisms that can contribute to the breakdown of SCN- into sulfur, carbon and nitrogen compounds. To this end, we performed metagenomic analysis of samples from two laboratory-scale bioreactors used to study SCN- and CN- degradation by established microbial consortia. Community analysis revealed the dominance of Thiobacillus spp. whose genomes harbor a previously unreported operon for SCN- degradation. Metabolic predictions suggest that a large portion of each bioreactor community is autotrophic, relying not on molasses in reactor feed, but using energy gained from oxidation of the sulfur compounds produced during SCN- degradation. Heterotrophs compose a smaller portion of the reactor bacterial community, and predation by phage and eukaryotes is predicted to affect community dynamics. Furthermore, genes for ammonium oxidation and denitrification were detected, possibly allowing removal of nitrogen as required for complete remediation of wastewater. These findings suggest possible optimization strategies for reactor design such as improved aerobic/anaerobic partitioning and elimination of organic carbon from reactor feed.",,SRP056932,"{""pubmed"": ""26031303""}",Metagenomic analysis of thiocyanate and cyanide biodegrading microbial consortia Metagenome,Metagenomics,,SRA448154,,,,,bioreactor metagenome,,16044508846,/dataset/290151

To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 oC for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 ± 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial activity (from 874 and 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 and 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, a COD removal between 68.9 % and 83.2 % was achieved at an organic loading rate ranging from 3.3 to 5.9 kg m-3 d-1. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tet genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron) in anaerobic sludge on Day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those inoculated on Day 0 (P< 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3,720 ± 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 ± 4 % at an OLR 1.2 ± 0.2 kg m-3 d-1, and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P< 0.01). The above result demonstrated that enhanced hydrolysis as a pretreatment method could enable efficient anaerobic treatment of oxytetracycline production wastewater containing high concentrations of oxytetracycline with significantly lower generation of ARGs.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-12-03"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-12-04""}",ERP020400,,Anaerobic Treatment of Antibiotic Production Wastewater Pretreated with Enhanced Hydrolysis: Simultaneous Reduction of COD and ARGs,Other,,ERA771265,,,,,metagenome,,6491081100,/dataset/5843309

Filaments with the Eikelboom 0092 morphotype are commonly associated with such bulking episodes. Members of the uncultured B45 phylotype, which is embraced within the phylum Chloroflexi, were recently shown to exhibit this morphology. Although these organisms are among the most abundant populations recorded in activated sludge processes, nothing is known about their metabolic characteristics. In this study, a genome sequence, representing the phylotype, was retrieved from a metagenome generated from an activated sludge WWTP plant. The genome consisted of two chromosomes and one plasmid, which were 4.0, 1.0, and 0.04 Mbps in size, respectively. A metabolic model was constructed for this organism, based on annotation of its genome, showing its ability to generate energy by aerobic respiration, utilizing oxygen, nitrite, or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors, or by fermentation of sugars.

However, it is unclear whether these reference organisms reflect the true ecological properties and in situ activities of the syntrophs that predominate in full-scale systems. Here we describe novel, metabolically versatile bacterial species playing key roles in SCFA oxidation which were ubiquitous in full-scale anaerobic sludge digesters. A genome-guided metatranscriptomic approach was employed, with 198 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) generated from the microbiome of two digesters. The transcriptomic response of individual MAG was studied after stimulation with low concentration of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, to identify the positively responsive members. Such responding MAGs included one bacterium of the family Pelotomaculaceae, and two bacteria of the class Desulfomonilia, which encoded complete propionate or butyrate beta-oxidation pathways that were significantly upregulated under propionate or butyrate stimulation, respectively. These three SCFA oxidizers were detected in most of the 38 investigated digesters, and encoded unique genomic features compared with the well-characterized populations, including the metabolic pathways for phosphite oxidation, nitrite, or sulfate reduction.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-03-31"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-02-18""}",ERP113854,,Investigating the response of digester metagenomes to various short-chain fatty acids using genome-centric metatranscriptomics,Other,,ERA1745989,,,,,anaerobic digester metagenome,,9617701034,/dataset/5860497

The aim of this study was to explore the structure of the microbial communities and the functional genes involved in the nitrogen removal. We used Illumina MiSeq Sequencer to conduct metagenome sequencing of microbial communities in the different stages of the treatment including buffering (B), primary aeration (PA), secondary aeration (SA) and sludge digestion (SD). The analysis of metagenome bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that four phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were dominant in the treatment process. The dominant genera were Burkholderia, Polaromonas, Albidiferax, Acidovorax, Geobacter, Dechloromonas, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas and others. Genes associated Nitrogen (N) metabolism were identified. Ssuch genesas gGlutamate synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), nitric oxide reductase (NIOR), nNitrous oxide reductase (NOOR), nitrate reductase (NAR), NAD.P.H nitrite reductase (NNIR), and fFerredoxin subunit nitrite reductase (FSNIR) were relatively dictateddetected. The frequency of gGlutamate synthase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), nNitrous oxide reductase (NOOR) and nitrate reductase(NAR) were higher in several genera than nitric oxide reductase (NIOR), NAD.P.H nitrite reductase (NNIR) and fFerredoxin subunit nitrite reductase (FSNIR) in the treatment process. The abundance of some genera associated with nitrogen metabolism and the higher frequency of genes relating nitrogen removal were mostly detected in PA and B corroborated with the high T-N removal in these two stages during the treatment process. These results indicate that a detailed nitrogen metabolism analysis of each treatment process could provide insight into the taxonomy and functions of the microbial biomass involved in nitrogen removal from the tannery wastewater.",,ERP005999,,Analysis of metagenome in a full scale tannery wastewater treatment,Metagenomics,,ERA315794,,,,,wastewater metagenome,,743814826,/dataset/750124

I will also test whether antibiotic resistance genes correlate with biodiversity, where I expect that a negative relationship between biodiversity and antibiotic resistance genes is indicative of active selection.

We find that the sludge from pharmaceutical production harbors around three times as much resistance genes as the municipal sewage sludge, with particularly large enrichments of aminoglycoside, amphenicol and sulfonamide resistance genes.

First, I want to test if specific operating metrics, such as temperature, pH, BOD concentration, and N concentration, have an influence on the presence and persistence of antibiotic resistance genes in sludge communities. Second, I want to determine whether antibiotic resistance genes are under active selection within WWTPs. To accomplish this second goal, I will evaluate whether antibiotic resistance genes are actively transcribed, which would suggest potential direct selection. I will also test whether antibiotic resistance genes correlate with biodiversity, where I expect that a negative relationship between biodiversity and antibiotic resistance genes is indicative of active selection. I will use a metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach to test for the presence and expression of target genes. This will help identify potential selection pressures that enable antibiotic resistance genes to pass through WWTPs and be released into receiving waters.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-03-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-04-04""}",ERP014782,,Studying the presence and selection of antibiotic resistance genes,Other,,ERA601957,,,,,metagenome,,4022837028,/dataset/4325587

To evaluate contributions by further microorganisms, the A. filiculoides microbiome and nitrogen metabolism in bacteria persistently associated with Azolla ferns were characterized. A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass and detection of N2O released. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns. The persistent but less abundant heterotrophic Rhizobiales bacteria possibly contributed to lowering O2 levels in leaf pockets but did not release detectable amounts of the strong greenhouse gas N2O.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-09-08"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-09-11""}",ERP021566,,Is there foul play in the leaf pocket?

Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns.

In this case study we conducted a four-week climate change incubation experiment, and tested the independent and combined effects of increased temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), on the microbiomes of a foundation species, the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, and the surrounding water column. The water and kelp microbiome responded differently to each of the climate stressors. In the water microbiome, each condition caused an increase in a distinct microbial order, whereas the kelp microbiome exhibited a reduction in the dominant kelp-associated order, Alteromondales. The water column microbiomes were most disrupted by elevated pCO2, with a 7.3 fold increase in Rhizobiales. The kelp microbiome was most influenced by elevated temperature and elevated temperature in combination with elevated pCO2. Kelp growth was negatively associated with elevated temperature, and the kelp microbiome showed a 5.3 fold increase Flavobacteriales and a 2.2 fold increase alginate degrading enzymes and sulfated polysaccharides. In contrast, kelp growth was positively associated with the combination of high temperature and high pCO2 'future conditions', with a 12.5 fold increase in Planctomycetales and 4.8 fold increase in Rhodobacteriales.

Chitinase and NRPS genes were expressed in these endophytic bacterial families primarily upon pathogen challenge of the roots. Following de novo genome assembly, a consortium of endophytic Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium was reconstructed that suppressed root disease more consistently than individual members. CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis further revealed that a novel NRPS-PKS hybrid gene cluster from Flavobacterium was key to the disease-suppressive activity of the endophytic consortium.

To evaluate contributions by further microorganisms, the A. filiculoides microbiome and nitrogen metabolism in bacteria persistently associated with Azolla ferns were characterized. A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass and detection of N2O released. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns. The persistent but less abundant heterotrophic Rhizobiales bacteria possibly contributed to lowering O2 levels in leaf pockets but did not release detectable amounts of the strong greenhouse gas N2O.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-09-08"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-09-11""}",ERP021566,,Is there foul play in the leaf pocket?

Viral diversity were detected by omics-based approaches. Adenoviruses (AdV) and enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated for their log reduction values (LRV) by digital PCR, and assessed for their infectious particles load using cell culture and immunofluorescence staining. The findings revealed that MBR treatment was successful in reducing the number of viral species throughout the treatment train. However, plant viruses like cucumber green mottle mosaic virus and melon necrotic spot virus remained abundant in the treated effluent. The presence of these plant viruses in treated effluent can undermine the use of such waters for agricultural irrigation. Human enteric viruses were present in comparatively lower abundance than the plant viruses, and were effectively removed by the MBR although at varying LRV for different enteric viruses. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3.7-logs through the MBR. No infectious AdV particles were found in effluent. In contrast, EV were less effectively removed by the MBR process. The EV copy numbers reduced by 1.7-logs post MBR while infectious EV decreased by an average of 2.0-logs. However, infectious EV remained in the chlorinated effluent, and occasionally in concentrations that approximate to the infectious dose. Overall results showed that a MBR-based WWTP effectively reduced viral diversity, viral load and its infectious capacity. However, differences in the removal efficiencies between AdV and EV particles were observed. Coupled with the presence of infectious EV particles in the chlorinated effluent, the findings suggest a potential concern arising from EV during reuse events. In addition, assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration of both infectious viral concentrations and LRV-centric guidelines.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-03-23"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-09-27""}",ERP017329,,"Membrane bioreactor-based wastewater treatment plant - Reduction of Viral Diversity, Load and Infectious Capacity",Other,,ERA710359,,,,,metagenome,,13559400756,/dataset/2722967

Three topsoil cores (0–10 cm layer) from each sampling point were collected and pooled to form a composite sample.DNA samples were purified with Genomic DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the protocol provided by manufacturer. Paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed for each sample using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, Ca, USA) according to the manufacturer`s instructions. DNA concentrations of the individual samples were quantified with Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA) and finally the samples DNA was pooled in equal proportions. The library was sequenced on the NextSeq 500 Illumina sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, Ca, USA).","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-10-03"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-07-25""}",ERP024239,,Microbial community structure in response to the drainage in a tropical peatland soil,Other,,ERA979948,,,,,soil metagenome,,3179762569,/dataset/3215011

Here, we demonstrate that three short read alignment-based methods , MetaMLST, PanPhlAn, and StrainPhlAn, can accurately, and rapidly, identify pathogenic strains in spinach metagenomes which were intentionally spiked  with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in a previous study. Subsequently, we employ the methods, in combination with other metagenomics approaches, to assess the safety of nunu, a traditional Ghanaian fermented milk product which is produced by the spontaneous fermentation of raw cow milk. We show that nunu samples are frequently contaminated with  bacteria associated with the bovine gut, and worryingly, we detect putatively pathogenic E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in a subset of nunu samples. Ultimately, our work establishes that short read alignment-based bioinformatics approaches are suitable food safety tools, and we describe a real-life example of their utilisation.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-06-10"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-06-10""}",ERP023064,,Strain-level metagenomic analysis of the fermented dairy beverage nunu highlights potential food safety risks,Other,,ERA926484,,,,,food metagenome,,533713348,/dataset/61901

To assess if environmental pollution of tetracycline promotes development of resistance, we determined minimal selective concentrations (MSCs) in biofilms of complex aquatic bacterial communities using both phenotypic and genotypic assays.  Taxonomic analyses of the biofilm communities suggested that composition was altered with increasing tetracycline concentrations.

To develop a community level understating of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment, we mapped microbial dynamics between hospital surfaces, air and water to patients and staff over the course of one year as a new hospital became operational. Immediately following the introduction of staff and patients, the hospital microbiome became dominated by human skin-associated bacteria. Patient skin samples had the lowest microbial diversity, while the greatest diversity was found on surfaces interacting with outdoor environments.

However, microbiome-disease association studies have not always reported consistent results, creating an increasing need for cross-study comparisons. Here we present a meta-analysis of five faecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) that are diverse in geographic sampling range and metagenomic data generation. We find a core of 30 species to be differentially abundant in CRC metagenomes (stringent FDR of 1E-05) including 8 species without genomic reference. Metagenomic classification models trained to detect CRC on one study generally maintained similar accuracy when applied to other studies. When combining training data across four studies, average accuracy on the fifth, held-out study was 0.83 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). These classifiers were CRC-specific as they maintained the expected false positive rate on other diseases. Functional metagenomic analysis uncovered an enrichment of amino acid and mucin degradation pathways in CRC metagenomes concomitant with a depletion of carbohydrate degradation, in line with established dietary CRC risk factors. We moreover found a strong enrichment of secondary bile acid conversion genes in CRC metagenomes suggesting a metabolic link between CRC-associated gut microbes and a high-risk diet rich in fat and red meat.

However, they have not always reported consistent results, thereby necessitating cross-study comparisons. Here, a meta-analysis of eight geographically and technically diverse fecal shotgun metagenomic studies of colorectal cancer (CRC, n?=?768), which was controlled for several confounders, identified a core set of 29 species significantly enriched in CRC metagenomes (false discovery rate (FDR)?<?1?×?10-5). CRC signatures derived from single studies maintained their accuracy in other studies. By training on multiple studies, we improved detection accuracy and disease specificity for CRC. Functional analysis of CRC metagenomes revealed enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes and depleted carbohydrate degradation genes. Moreover, we inferred elevated production of secondary bile acids from CRC metagenomes, suggesting a metabolic link between cancer-associated gut microbes and a fat- and meat-rich diet.

Maternal bacteria are expected to seed the infant intestine and thus play an important role in early development. However, only tracking of strictly defined microbial strains can clarify where the intestinal bacteria come from, how long the initial colonisers persist and whether colonisation by other strains from the environment can replace existing ones. Using rare single nucleotide variants in faecal metagenomes of infants and their family members, we show strong evidence of selective and persistent transmission of maternal strain populations to the vaginally born infant, and their occasional replacement by strains from the environment, including those from family members, in later childhood. Only strains from the classes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are essential components of the infant microbiome, are transmitted from the mother and persist for at least one year. In contrast, maternal strains of Clostridia, a dominant class in the mother's gut microbiome, are not observed in the infant. Instead, Clostridia strains are recruited from the environment early on, and fail to colonise persistently until after the first year. Caesarean-born infants showed a striking lack of maternal transmission at birth. For all children analysed, strain influx from the family environment was observed, peaking after the first year. Furthermore, even in adulthood strain sharing between family members, including spouses and siblings, is more common than between unrelated individuals. This suggests that re-colonisation occurs in adulthood. When studying families, fathers appear to be more frequently donors of novel strains to other family members than receivers. Taken together, after selective maternal seeding of the infant gut, species from the environment are recruited, with a rare but continuing strain influx over time.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-02-12"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-12-20""}",ERP105838,,Selective maternal seeding and environment shape the human gut microbiome,Other,,ERA1167337,,,,,gut metagenome,,374601051,/dataset/5163437

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants’ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exception includes ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are highly correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae species in the preterm infant gut microbiota. In addition to AR genes relevant to specific antibiotics likely providing a protective function, we show that all antibiotic treatments also result in widespread collateral microbiome impact through enrichment of AR genes with no known direct activity against the specific antibiotic treatment.",,SRP069019,,Metagenomic sequencing of preterm infant gut microbiota raw sequence reads,Other,,SRA342712,,,,,human gut metagenome,,859249186,/dataset/236706

We surveyed the variation landscape of 71 prevalent microbial species in 2144 human fecal metagenomes, and show that in 44 of these, accounting for 72% of the total assigned microbial abundance, single nucleotide variation can be clustered and stratified into sub-populations (termed subspecies). Individuals are usually dominated by only one such subspecies (per species), as expected of closely related organisms from ecological theory. Geographical dispersal patterns differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To demonstrate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we performed a metagenomic analysis, independent of reference genomes, of the gene content that consistently differs between conspecific subspecies, allowing us to associate groups of genes to properties of the microbial community and to the host. For example, some Eubacterium rectale subspecies specifically harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI and higher blood fasting insulin levels. Taken together, subspecies are a natural taxonomic level in prokaryotes and facilitate the functional and ecological understanding of the human gut microbiome in conjunction with its host.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-12-01"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-11-02"", ""Gut metagenome"": null}",ERP019502,,Subspecies in the global human gut microbiome,Other,,ERA763680,,,,Human,Homo sapiens,,1647924236,/dataset/3231300

To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Our findings provide new insight into the skin virome, its interactions with the whole metagenome, and establish a foundation for understanding these dynamics in skin health and disease.",,SRP049645,,Human skin bacterial metagenome and Virome Metagenome,Metagenomics,,SRA200640,,,,,human skin metagenome,,402715090,/dataset/1426388

General information: Illumina libraries were built for nine ancient DNA extracts prepared from 50 mg dental calculus samples from individuals B61 and G12. Target DNA quantity for each library preparation was 500-700ng. For those extracts with low DNA concentration, all of the available extract was used. A negative extraction control was processed alongside the experimental extracts and monitored for contamination. No contamination was observed. In an ancient DNA clean room, DNA extracts were repaired using a NEBNext End Repair and dA-Tailing kit following manufacturer?s instructions. Short Illumina Indexed PE Adaptors were added to the extracts as follows: 1ml of 15mM adaptor for libraries S2, S5, S6, S7, and S8 (high concentration extracts), and 1ml of 5mM adaptor for libraries S1, S3, and S9 (low concentration extracts). A unique, 6-nucleotide index was used for each library, and each index was distinguished by at least two differences from other indexes. Quick T4 Ligase (1ml) was added to each library and incubated at 25?C for 10 min. After adaptor ligation, the libraries were purified on a MinElute spin column (Qiagen) and eluted into 20ml EB buffer. The libraries were then PCR-amplified in two rounds to increase concentration and complete adapter assembly. At the end of library construction, the total length of the indexed adaptors is 122bp. PCR inhibition was observed during the first amplification step, and the following PCR reactions were optimized by sample to yield the best amplification. The first PCR reaction was set up as follows: 25ml Phusion HF Master Mix (Finnzymes), 2ml 10mM forward PE primer, 2ml 10mM reverse indexed PE primer, 13ml H2O. For libraries S1, S3 and the negative extraction control, 8ml library was added to the reaction. For libraries S2, S4 and S9, 1ml library and 7ml H2O were added. Library amplification for S2 and S4 was repeated with 1ml library, 1ml BSA (2.5mg/ml) and 6ml H2O. For libraries S5-S8, 1ml of diluted 1:9 libraries and 7ml H2O were added. PCR tubes were then sealed and transferred to a PCR facility. Cycling conditions were: 98?C for 60s, 12 cycles of (98?C for 20s, 60?C for 30s, 72?C for 30s), and a final extension of 72?C for 5 min. PCR products (4ml) were visualized on a 2% agarose gel to confirm amplification and purified on a MinElute spin column (Qiagen) and eluted into 20ml EB buffer. Amplification products were observed for all nine archaeological calculus samples, but no amplification was observed in the negative extraction control. A second PCR reaction was set up as follows: 12ml Phusion HF Master Mix (Finnzymes), 1ml 10mM forward PE primer, 1ml 10mM reverse indexed PE primer, 1ml H2O, and 8ml library. Cycling conditions were: 98?C for 120s, 8 cycles of (98?C for 20s, 60?C for 35s, 72?C for 30s), and a final extension of 72?C for 5 min. PCR products (4ml) were visualized on a 2% agarose gel to confirm amplification and purified on a MinElute spin column (Qiagen) and eluted into 20ml EB buffer. Library DNA concentration was measured with a Qubit DNA High-Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and the duplicate S2 and S4 libraries were pooled. Concentration and size distribution of the libraries was determined on a Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA 1000 chip (Agilent Technologies). Mean library length ranged from 193 bp (S9) to 325 bp (S8), which, after subtracting the adaptor length of 122bp, indicates a mean extract insert length of 71-203bp. This length is consistent with ancient DNA, which is known to be highly fragmented. DNA concentration was further characterized using a qPCR SYBRGreen Assay, and the nine libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations. Following cluster generation, libraries were sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2000 in a 100 bp, single-end run, followed by base-calling using standard Illumina software (RTA version 1.12.4.2).

The samples in this study were obtained from four skeletons (G12, B17, B61, and B78) from the medieval site of Dalheim, Germany (ca. AD 950-1200). The skeletons exhibited osteological evidence of periodontal disease. A total of nine indexed Illumina shotgun metagenomic libraries were prepared from B61 and G12 dental calculus using different extraction and decontamination protocols. The nine indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a single Illumina HiSeq 2000 lane. A total of 32 indexed 454 targeted 16S rRNA libraries (V3, V5, and V6 regions) were prepared from paired dental calculus and dentine samples from G12, B17, B61, and B78, as well as from carious dentine and abscessed bone from B17. The 32 indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a 454 GS Junior.

Understanding these variations is needed for comparisons and for potential pooling across studies. Therefore, we performed whole-genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing on fecal samples from 52 pre-treatment colorectal cancer cases and 52 matched controls from Washington, DC. We compared findings from a previous 16S rRNA study to the metagenomics-derived taxonomy within the same population. In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in the French population, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In conclusion, metagenomic sequencing results reproduced most, but not all of the major taxonomic associations with colorectal cancer previously observed from 16S rRNA profiles. In addition, colorectal cancer in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified from the French study. More within and between population comparisons are needed to identify sources of variation and disease associations that can be reproduced despite these variations. Future studies must have larger sample sizes or pool data across studies to have sufficient power to detect associations that are reproducible and significant after correction for multiple testing.",,ERP013933,,"Reproducibility of associations between the human gut microbiome and colorectal cancer assessed in a patient population from Washington, DC, USA",Other,,ERA565937,,,,,human gut metagenome,,1126072353,/dataset/34462

Maternal bacteria are expected to seed the infant intestine and thus play an important role in early development. However, only tracking of strictly defined microbial strains can clarify where the intestinal bacteria come from, how long the initial colonisers persist and whether colonisation by other strains from the environment can replace existing ones. Using rare single nucleotide variants in faecal metagenomes of infants and their family members, we show strong evidence of selective and persistent transmission of maternal strain populations to the vaginally born infant, and their occasional replacement by strains from the environment, including those from family members, in later childhood. Only strains from the classes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are essential components of the infant microbiome, are transmitted from the mother and persist for at least one year. In contrast, maternal strains of Clostridia, a dominant class in the mother's gut microbiome, are not observed in the infant. Instead, Clostridia strains are recruited from the environment early on, and fail to colonise persistently until after the first year. Caesarean-born infants showed a striking lack of maternal transmission at birth. For all children analysed, strain influx from the family environment was observed, peaking after the first year. Furthermore, even in adulthood strain sharing between family members, including spouses and siblings, is more common than between unrelated individuals. This suggests that re-colonisation occurs in adulthood. When studying families, fathers appear to be more frequently donors of novel strains to other family members than receivers. Taken together, after selective maternal seeding of the infant gut, species from the environment are recruited, with a rare but continuing strain influx over time.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-02-12"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-12-20""}",ERP105838,,Selective maternal seeding and environment shape the human gut microbiome,Other,,ERA1167337,,,,,gut metagenome,,560100673,/dataset/5514263

To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities.

However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.  Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.  Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",,ERP009422,,Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,Other,,ERA407340,,,,human,Homo sapiens,,1245138346,/dataset/2601626

Individuals are usually dominated by only one such subspecies (per species), as expected of closely related organisms from ecological theory. Geographical dispersal patterns differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To demonstrate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we performed a metagenomic analysis, independent of reference genomes, of the gene content that consistently differs between conspecific subspecies, allowing us to associate groups of genes to properties of the microbial community and to the host. For example, some Eubacterium rectale subspecies specifically harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI and higher blood fasting insulin levels.

For one individual (UC0125.US), three sequencing runs were performed from 2 plasma aliquots.  Plasma samples were clarified of particulate matter by centrifugation at 2650g for 5 min at room temperature, and then were pre-treated with benzonase (500 U/ml; (Sigma)) for 3 hrs at 37oC in 1X benzonase buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, and 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2) to degrade free DNA and RNA. For extractions, the QiaAMP Viral Mini (Qiagen), MagMax Viral RNA (Ambion), and Abbott RNA or total nucleic acid sample preps on the m2000 instrument were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, all of which successfully recovered HPgV-2. RNA was concentrated using RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 columns (Zymo Research) and eluted in 7 Î¼l of DNase/RNase-Free water.  Randomly primed cDNA libraries were constructed from 5 Âµl of RNA using the OvationÂ® RNA-SeqV2 kit (NuGen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA concentrations were measured on a Qubit Fluorometer using dsDNA BR reagents (Molecular Probes/Life Technologies) and diluted to 0.2 ng/Âµl. One nanogram (5 Âµl) was used as input for Nextera XT tagmentation (Illumina) according to manufacturer's instructions, and barcoded libraries were amplified with 16 cycles of PCR. Libraries were quantified on a BioAnalyzer 2200 TapeStation, pooled to a final concentration of 6-12 pM in HT buffer with 1% PhiX loading control, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq as 150 nt paired-ends reads using v2 chemistry. To exclude reagent contamination, additional experiments were performed with the SMARTerTM PCR cDNA synthesis (Clontech), OvationÂ® Single Cell RNA-seq, and OvationÂ® Human Blood RNA-seq library systems, each of which also generated HPgV-2 sequence.  Barcodes were de-multiplexed on the MiSeq instrument and reads were filtered for Q-scores above 30. FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0 software (CLC bio/Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark), Illumina paired-end reads 1 and 2 were merged (paired-end distance 100-250 nt), and duplicate reads were removed. Reads were trimmed for quality (limit=0.05) and ambiguity (2 nt max), with reads below 50 nt discarded; paired-end reads and broken pairs were then aligned to the UC0125.US sequence (Fig. 1E). The following alignment settings were applied: mismatch=2, insertion=3, deletion=3, length fraction=0.7, and similarity fraction=0.8.   Where required, gaps in NGS sequence were filled using One-Step RT-PCR (Qiagen) and Sanger sequenced on an ABI3130 instrument.  Sequences of primers used to characterize the index case and fill in additional genomes are available upon request.  Contigs from multiple runs of NGS or Sanger data were assembled in Sequencher 5.2.3 software to generate strain consensus sequences, and the polyprotein open reading frame was confirmed in DNAStar SeqBuilder software.

Maternal bacteria are expected to seed the infant intestine and thus play an important role in early development. However, only tracking of strictly defined microbial strains can clarify where the intestinal bacteria come from, how long the initial colonisers persist and whether colonisation by other strains from the environment can replace existing ones. Using rare single nucleotide variants in faecal metagenomes of infants and their family members, we show strong evidence of selective and persistent transmission of maternal strain populations to the vaginally born infant, and their occasional replacement by strains from the environment, including those from family members, in later childhood. Only strains from the classes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are essential components of the infant microbiome, are transmitted from the mother and persist for at least one year. In contrast, maternal strains of Clostridia, a dominant class in the mother's gut microbiome, are not observed in the infant. Instead, Clostridia strains are recruited from the environment early on, and fail to colonise persistently until after the first year. Caesarean-born infants showed a striking lack of maternal transmission at birth. For all children analysed, strain influx from the family environment was observed, peaking after the first year. Furthermore, even in adulthood strain sharing between family members, including spouses and siblings, is more common than between unrelated individuals. This suggests that re-colonisation occurs in adulthood. When studying families, fathers appear to be more frequently donors of novel strains to other family members than receivers. Taken together, after selective maternal seeding of the infant gut, species from the environment are recruited, with a rare but continuing strain influx over time.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-02-12"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-12-20""}",ERP105838,,Selective maternal seeding and environment shape the human gut microbiome,Other,,ERA1167337,,,,,gut metagenome,,1212931199,/dataset/5723529

However, the temporal variability of the healthy gut microbiome has not yet been studied in depth using metagenomics and little is known about the effects of different sampling and preservation approaches. We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.  Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.  Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",,ERP009422,,Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,Other,,ERA407340,,,,human,Homo sapiens,,1311295934,/dataset/177576

In addition, metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways in the Washington, DC cases and controls were compared to cases and controls recruited in France whose specimens were processed using the same platform. Associations between the presence of fecal Fusobacteria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas with colorectal cancer detected by 16S rRNA were reproduced by metagenomics, whereas higher relative abundance of Clostridia in cancer cases based on 16S rRNA was merely borderline based on metagenomics. Considering significant cancer associations with the relative abundance of genes, modules, and pathways in the French population, statistically significant associations in the Washington, DC population were detected for four out of 10 genes, three out of nine modules, and seven out of 17 pathways. In conclusion, metagenomic sequencing results reproduced most, but not all of the major taxonomic associations with colorectal cancer previously observed from 16S rRNA profiles. In addition, colorectal cancer in the Washington, DC study was associated with 39% of the metagenome-predicted genes, modules, and pathways identified from the French study.

The normal progression of colonization of preterm infants is a patterned, yet chaotic, process, and thought to be chiefly driven by host factors. While preterm infants almost universally receive early and often repeated and/or prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, it remains unclear if and how specific antibiotics alter the developmental progression of the gut microbiota in this population. By analyzing 401 fecal samples from 84 longitudinally-sampled preterm infants, we demonstrate that meropenem, cefotaxime, and ticarcillin-clavulanate significantly reduce species richness during their administration, and significantly enrich or deplete specific bacterial species and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness. We show this response is predictable with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two AR genes before treatment. To more fully investigate the role of the gut-associated resistome in response to specific antibiotics, we performed functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 16 clinically relevant antibiotics from a set of 21 preterm infants’ gut microbiota. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as providing any resistance phenotype. Combined with deep shotgun sequencing of all 401 fecal samples, we find that multidrug resistant Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, which are commonly associated with nosocomial infections, dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. We show that AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and highly correlated (p<0.001) with the abundance of a single species.

Individuals are usually dominated by only one such subspecies (per species), as expected of closely related organisms from ecological theory. Geographical dispersal patterns differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To demonstrate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we performed a metagenomic analysis, independent of reference genomes, of the gene content that consistently differs between conspecific subspecies, allowing us to associate groups of genes to properties of the microbial community and to the host. For example, some Eubacterium rectale subspecies specifically harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI and higher blood fasting insulin levels.

Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.

Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.","{""parent_bioproject"": ""PRJNA46305""}",SRP002480,"{""NIH HMP DACC"": ""http://www.hmpdacc.org/"", ""pubmed"": ""25279917"", ""NCBI Project: HMP Roadmap"": ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA43021""}",Gene-Environment Interactions at the Skin Surface,Metagenomics,,SRA196680,,,,,human skin metagenome,,381794746,/dataset/1267769

Here, we conducted a large-scale survey of population stratification in prokaryotic species, sampled from their natural habitat, without isolation or cultivation biases. We surveyed the variation landscape of 71 prevalent microbial species in 2144 human fecal metagenomes, and show that in 44 of these, accounting for 72% of the total assigned microbial abundance, single nucleotide variation can be clustered and stratified into sub-populations (termed subspecies). Individuals are usually dominated by only one such subspecies (per species), as expected of closely related organisms from ecological theory. Geographical dispersal patterns differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To demonstrate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we performed a metagenomic analysis, independent of reference genomes, of the gene content that consistently differs between conspecific subspecies, allowing us to associate groups of genes to properties of the microbial community and to the host. For example, some Eubacterium rectale subspecies specifically harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI and higher blood fasting insulin levels. Taken together, subspecies are a natural taxonomic level in prokaryotes and facilitate the functional and ecological understanding of the human gut microbiome in conjunction with its host.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2017-12-01"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-11-02"", ""Gut metagenome"": null}",ERP019502,,Subspecies in the global human gut microbiome,Other,,ERA763682,,,,Human,Homo sapiens,,88262550,/dataset/3110390

Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.","{""parent_bioproject"": ""PRJNA46305""}",SRP002480,"{""NIH HMP DACC"": ""http://www.hmpdacc.org/"", ""pubmed"": ""25279917"", ""NCBI Project: HMP Roadmap"": ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA43021""}",Gene-Environment Interactions at the Skin Surface,Metagenomics,,SRA357048,,,,,human skin metagenome,,475676064,/dataset/437921

Geographical dispersal patterns differ between phyla, with Firmicutes subspecies being significantly more geographically restricted. To demonstrate the functional significance of the delineated subspecies, we performed a metagenomic analysis, independent of reference genomes, of the gene content that consistently differs between conspecific subspecies, allowing us to associate groups of genes to properties of the microbial community and to the host. For example, some Eubacterium rectale subspecies specifically harbor an accessory pro-inflammatory flagellum operon that is associated with lower gut community diversity, higher host BMI and higher blood fasting insulin levels.

We performed metagenomic analysis on fecal samples from seven subjects collected over a period of up to two years to investigate temporal variability and assess preservation-induced variation, specifically, fresh frozen compared to RNALater. We also monitored short-term disturbances caused by antibiotic treatment and bowel cleansing in one subject.  Results: We find that the human gut microbiome is temporally stable and highly personalized at both taxonomic and functional levels. Over multiple time-points, samples from the same subject clustered together, even in the context of a large dataset of 888 European and American fecal metagenomes. One exception was observed in an antibiotic intervention case where, more than one year after the treatment, samples did not resemble the pre-treatment state. Clustering was not affected by preservation method. No species differed significantly in abundance, and only 0.36% of gene families were differentially abundant between preservation methods.  Conclusions: Technical variability is small compared to the temporal variability of an unperturbed gut microbiome, which in turn is much smaller than the observed between-subject variability. Thus, short-term preservation of fecal samples in RNALater is an appropriate and cost-effective alternative to freezing of fecal samples for metagenomic studies.",,ERP009422,,Temporal and technical variability of human gut metagenomes,Other,,ERA407340,,,,human,Homo sapiens,,1399650408,/dataset/2362373

Using a previously validated self-sampling stool collection method (PMID24843156), participants provided up to four stool samples – one set of samples collected approximately 48 hours apart followed by a second set approximately 6 months later. DNA extracted from 929 stool samples and RNA extracted from 378 stool samples was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw data were filtered to remove low quality and human reads. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic read data were then profiled for functional and taxonomic composition using the HUMAnN2 and MetaPhlAn2 platforms respectively.",,SRP096283,,Human gut metagenome and metatranscriptome raw sequence reads.,Other,,SRA524775,,,,,human gut metagenome,,784468562,/dataset/1928176
