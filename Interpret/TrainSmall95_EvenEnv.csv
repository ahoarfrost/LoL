However, it is unclear whether these reference organisms reflect the true ecological properties and in situ activities of the syntrophs that predominate in full-scale systems. Here we describe novel, metabolically versatile bacterial species playing key roles in SCFA oxidation which were ubiquitous in full-scale anaerobic sludge digesters. A genome-guided metatranscriptomic approach was employed, with 198 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) generated from the microbiome of two digesters. The transcriptomic response of individual MAG was studied after stimulation with low concentration of acetate, propionate, or butyrate, to identify the positively responsive members. Such responding MAGs included one bacterium of the family Pelotomaculaceae, and two bacteria of the class Desulfomonilia, which encoded complete propionate or butyrate beta-oxidation pathways that were significantly upregulated under propionate or butyrate stimulation, respectively. These three SCFA oxidizers were detected in most of the 38 investigated digesters, and encoded unique genomic features compared with the well-characterized populations, including the metabolic pathways for phosphite oxidation, nitrite, or sulfate reduction.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-03-31"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2019-02-18""}",ERP113854,,Investigating the response of digester metagenomes to various short-chain fatty acids using genome-centric metatranscriptomics,Other,,ERA1745989,,,,,anaerobic digester metagenome,,5271363950.0,/dataset/5860492

Linking DOM quality and quantity to microbial community complexity and function are crucial steps toward a mechanistic understanding of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding these relationships at the microbial scale will enable us to make predictions about landscape-scale environmental change and its effect on aquatic carbon cycling and food web processes. In this study, I aim to investigate the effect of organic matter manipulation on the molecular structure of DOM and the microbial community composition and function in freshwater boreal lakes.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-01-23"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2016-11-25""}",ERP019980,,Effects of organic matter manipulation on bacterial community diversity and function,Other,,ERA769156,,,,,metagenome,,317205063.0,/dataset/5639144

State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings.

To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-05-30"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-11-18""}",ERP020652,"{""PUBMED"": ""30069051""}",Global analysis of soil microbiomes,Other,,ERA836085,,,,,soil metagenome,,4183637378.0,/dataset/3792415

To understand these human interventions, we compared the microbiota present in abiotic surfaces of clinical settings and other built environments. State-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies as well as genome and plasmid reconstructions allowed us to determine that increased confinement and cleaning was associated with a loss of microbial diversity and a shift from Gram-positive (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes) to Gram-negative (Proteobacteria) bacteria as well as within genomes (Acinetobacter). Moreover, the microbiome of highly maintained built environments showed a completely different resistome and present a higher diversity of resistance genes than naturally unrestricted buildings. Our results highlight that the loss of microbial diversity correlates with an increase of resistances and indicate the need of implementing strategies to restore diversity to counteract propagation of resistances in the future.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2019-01-23"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-07-06""}",ERP109748,,Comparative metagenomics of controlled and uncontrolled built environments.,Other,,ERA1545701,,,,,indoor metagenome,,10691205600.0,/dataset/4533685

Soil microbial communities mediate numerous essential ecosystem functions, and recent studies show that forest harvesting alters soil community composition. From a long-term soil productivity study site in a temperate coniferous forest in British Columbia, 21 forest soil shotgun metagenomes were generated, totaling 187 Gb. A method to analyze unassembled metagenome reads from the complex community was optimized and validated. The subsequent metagenome analysis revealed that, 12 years after forest harvesting, there were 16% and 8% reductions in relative abundances of biomass decomposition genes in the organic and mineral soil layers, respectively. Organic and mineral soil layers differed markedly in genetic potential for biomass degradation, with the organic layer having greater potential and being more strongly impacted by harvesting. Gene families were disproportionately affected, and we identified 41 gene families consistently affected by harvesting, including families involved in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin degradation. The results strongly suggest that harvesting profoundly altered below-ground cycling of carbon and other nutrients at this site, with potentially important consequences for forest regeneration. Thus, it is important to determine whether these changes foreshadow long-term changes in forest productivity or resilience and whether these changes are broadly characteristic of harvested forests.",,ERP009498,,Forest harvesting reduces the soil metagenomic potential for biomass decomposition,Other,,ERA739734,,,,,soil metagenome,,17635704600.0,/dataset/2553995

A major focus of these efforts is the larval pool of reef fish, which is crucial to population replenishment and dispersal in the coral reef. However, species-level community-wide monitoring of reef fish larvae was so far impractical due to the high morphological identity between larvae of different species. Here we used barcode-based, amplification-free, high throughput metagenomics to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a habitat that includes >1.5% of all world fish species. We analyzed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples collected during 2010-2011 stratified over sites, depth and seasons. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a database of genomic barcodes compiled for 77% of adult reef fish in the region. This yielded species-level, quantitative reconstruction of the larval community, allowing species abundance estimation. We documented spatio-temporal preferences of larvae of multiple species, and found significant correlations between the abundance of adults and their larvae, suggesting that larval supply plays a major role in determining local adult densities. We also documented larval flux of species whose adults were never sighted in the region, suggesting recruitment barriers as the major cause for adult absence. Our data also suggest larvae as a dispersal mode for Lessepsian migration of Indo-Pacific species into the Mediterranean.

The cells contain an excessive number of transposable elements and we hypothesize that these are involved in, intracellular, inter- and intra-chromosome gene re-arrangements; however, the integrity of operons is maintained. We further hypothesize that gene convergence is strongly reduced in these cells as suggested by the high diversity of the usually conserved 16S rRNA gene. Imaging the 16S rRNA distribution inside the cells points to the potentially spatial-differential expression of genes. Thus, intracellular gene transfer (iGT) leads to a large genetic diversity and potentially accelerated evolution.

However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses. Analyses of these bins revealed that Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-10-01"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2017-12-05""}",ERP105559,,Metagenome data from DNA stable isotope probing of Stiffkey saltmarsh sediment microcosms to investigate methanogenesis from choline,Other,,ERA1153289,,,,,sediment metagenome,,2795521560.0,/dataset/5068204

This information was paired with 16S amplicon sequencing, environmental measurements, and denitrification end product measurements in order to elucidate the complex relationships mentioned above. Distinct patterns of denitrification gene abundance were observed at the landscape scale. One subset of denitrification genes, nirS, nosZ, and cNor, were found to co-occur at sites with environmental conditions most favorable for denitrification, indicating that specialized denitrifying communities exist at these sites. Moreover, the genes nirK and qNor were found to show a negative correlation with the previously mentioned gene subset.

To solve this problem, a pilot system consisting of enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment and an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor in succession was constructed for treating oxytetracycline production wastewater, and the performance was evaluated in a pharmaceutical factory in comparison with a full-scale anaerobic system operated in parallel. After enhanced hydrolysis under conditions of pH 7 and 85 oC for 6 h, oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 11,086 ± 602 mg L-1 was directly introduced into the pilot UASB reactor. With the effective removal of oxytetracycline and its antibacterial activity (from 874 and 900 mg L-1 to less than 0.61 and 0.84 mg L-1, respectively) by the enhanced hydrolysis pretreatment, a COD removal between 68.9 % and 83.2 % was achieved at an organic loading rate ranging from 3.3 to 5.9 kg m-3 d-1. At the same time, the relative abundances of the total tet genes and a mobile element (Class 1 integron) in anaerobic sludge on Day 96 were one order of magnitude lower than those inoculated on Day 0 (P< 0.01). The reduction of ARGs was further demonstrated by metagenomic sequencing. By comparison, the full-scale anaerobic system treating oxytetracycline production wastewater with an influent COD of 3,720 ± 128 mg L-1 after dilution exhibited a COD removal of 51 ± 4 % at an OLR 1.2 ± 0.2 kg m-3 d-1, and a total tet gene abundance in sludge was five times higher than the pilot-scale system (P< 0.01).

Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns.

To develop a community level understating of how microorganisms colonize and move through the hospital environment, we mapped microbial dynamics between hospital surfaces, air and water to patients and staff over the course of one year as a new hospital became operational. Immediately following the introduction of staff and patients, the hospital microbiome became dominated by human skin-associated bacteria. Patient skin samples had the lowest microbial diversity, while the greatest diversity was found on surfaces interacting with outdoor environments. The microbiota of patient room surfaces, especially bedrails, consistently resembled the skin microbial community of the current patient within 24 hours of occupancy, with degree of similarity significantly correlated to higher humidity and lower temperatures. Microbial similarity between staff members showed a significant seasonal trend suggesting interpersonal microbial transmission in hospital environments is influenced by built environment parameters.",,ERP014653,,Hospital Metagenomics,Other,,ERA587179,,,,,metagenome,,326706922.0,/dataset/1773220

Diet, in turn, influences the composition of the gut microbiota. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet established for treatment of therapy-resistant epilepsy in children. Its efficacy in reducing seizures has been confirmed, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The diet has also shown positive effects in a wide range of other diseases, including Alzheimer´s, depression, autism, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. We collected fecal samples from 12 children with therapy-resistant epilepsy before starting KD and after three months on the diet. Parents did not start KD and served as diet controls. Applying shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing we established both taxonomic and functional profiles. While alpha diversity was not changed significantly during the diet, differences in both taxonomic and functional composition were detected. Bifidobacteria were significantly diminished during the intervention as well as E. rectale and Dialister. An increase in E. coli was observed on KD. Functional analysis revealed changes in 29 SEED subsystems including the reduction of seven pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Decomposition of these shifts indicated that bifidobacteria and Escherichia were important contributors to the observed functional shifts. As health-promoting, fiber-consuming bacteria become less abundant during KD we raise concern about the effects of the diet on the gut microbiota and overall health. Further studies need to investigate whether these changes are necessary for the therapeutic effect of KD.","{""ENA-FIRST-PUBLIC"": ""2018-12-20"", ""ENA-LAST-UPDATE"": ""2018-09-28""}",ERP111104,,The ketogenic diet influences taxonomic and functional composition of the gut microbiota in children with severe epilepsy,Other,,ERA1614073,,,,,metagenome,,1341525696.0,/dataset/3908524
